        Izzy Schreiber🎀💟🐾🐕
      </h2>
       Izzy is my dog. We rescued her from a shelter in Beverly Hills, CA. We're not completely sure of her exact breed, but she is definitely soome sort of chihuahua/terrier. She is just under 6 pounds and she's fully grown. Her favorite things to do are cuddle, play fetch, and eat. We all sit at the dinner table and Izzy hops up on the chairs and sits and waits for her food. She is <em>very</em> serious about food. When she is sitting at the table, she sits and stares at our dinner and doesn't want anyone distracting her. Sometimes she starts shaking because she wants it so bad. She never <strong> EVER </strong> sleeps alone, she always must be cuddling with someone whether it's my mom, me or my brother, but it's usually always me. Her favorite word is "chicken", and that's how you get her to come to you. She gets the zoomies late at night and triest to run away because she thinks you're playing a game when you're just trying to sleep. We got Izzy during Covid and she's <strong>THE BEST DOG EVER!</strong>
